## End-User Personas
Our end-user will generally be a normal person with a fitness goal or interest. For example, lets say we have a normal office worker named Steve. Steve wants to make a return to the dating scene and as a result, wants to lose some fat. He starts going out to the gym a few times a week, and starts to limit his calories per day. Unfortunately, his eating habits vary day by day, and he has no time to cook. He usually gets take out, or eats whatever lunch is provided by the company, and so he doesn't usually know the calories counts of his meals. Thus, he starts using Calorie Counter, which provides him approximate nutrition information for his meals with a simple picture of each meal and allows him to monitor his eating habits long-term. Eventually, through perserverence, he makes a successful redebut on the dating scene.

Steve's background could have been completely different, but the main point is a desire to monitor eating habits for fitness/health reasons. Steve could be a college student, or even a stay-at home dad, but as long as he wanted to get nutrition information on his meals in a simple and intuitive way, he would find a use for Calorie Counter. Alternatives today exist in fitness apps such as MyFitnessPal but adding meal content part by part is slow and tedious. Calorie Counter needs to and will be a fast and simple way to check our calorie intake daily with a simple picture per meal.


## Use Cases
![Use Cases](use_cases.png)
\
Title: Sign-up\
Actor: Customer

Scenario: A new customer will be able to sign up for an account in the application so that the customer's associated food habits and its associated data could be stored.

Title: Sign-in\
Actor: Customer

Scenario: A returning customer will be able to sign in to their existing account in the application so that the they can see their food habits and its trend so that they can take some action if they want.

Title: Check calorie count of food item\
Actor: Customer

Scenario: The customer wants to know the calorie count of an item. He opens the "calorie-counter" application, takes a photo of the food and the application automatically classifies the item along with the calorie count of a standard serving It would also ask the customer if he.she would like to add the food the meal after viewing the calorie count.
